# Car Wash Queue Simulation

Project Overview

This project simulates the working of a car wash facility where multiple cars arrive, wait in a queue, and are served one at a time by washing stations. 
It demonstrates the practical use of queue data structures in solving real-world scheduling and resource allocation problems.

## Objective

- Cars arrive and are added to the queue.
- Washing stations serve cars one at a time.
- When a station becomes free, the next car in the queue moves forward.
- Once a car is washed, it leaves the system.
- This project was developed as part of a team collaboration (May 2024) to gain deeper understanding of data structures, algorithms, and simulation techniques.

---

## Features

- Simulation of car arrivals and departures.
- Dynamic handling of waiting cars using a queue.
- Fair allocation: cars are washed in First-Come-First-Served (FCFS) order.
- Efficient management of car wash stations.

---

## Tech Stack

- Language: C Programming Language
- Editor/IDE: Visual Studio Code
- Concepts Used: Queue Data Structure, Algorithm Design, Simulation

---

## Working

- Cars arrive at the car wash facility.
- If no station is available, the car joins the waiting queue.
- When a station becomes free, the next car in the queue is assigned.
- After washing is complete, the car leaves the system.
- The process continues until all cars are washed.

---

## Execution

- Compile the C program using GCC or any C compiler.
- Run the simulation and observe how cars are queued and processed by washing stations.

---

## Learning Outcomes

- Understanding of queue operations (enqueue, dequeue).
- Practical application of data structures in real-world problems.
- Improved skills in C programming and algorithm design.
- Experience in team collaboration and simulation-based problem solving.
